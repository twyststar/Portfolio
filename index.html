          <p>This project was created to learn how to apply our own CSS styles along with our newly-discovered Bootstrap options. The goal was to recreate an old Wikipedia home page from a screnshot. Created with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with Aaron N. at Epicodus.</p>

          <p>A mockup webpage of imaginary German vacations. This was a lesson project introducing Bootstrap, and was the first time we used it. Created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with Aaron N. at Epicodus.</p>

          <a href="#"><img src="images/future.png" alt="Photo of a webpage"></a>
          <p>This was a mock-portfolio page created while taking online courses in basic HTML and CSS with codecademy.com. I pushed it to github so I could polish issues like scalability once I have learned more.</p>
