          <a href="#"><img src="images/wiki.png" alt="Photo of a webpage"></a>
          <p>This project was created to learn how to apply our own CSS styles along with our newly-discovered Bootstrap options. The goal was to recreate an old Wikipedia home page from a screnshot. Created with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with Aaron N. at Epicodus.</p>

          <a href="#"><img src="images/vacation.png" alt="Photo of a webpage"></a>
          <p>A mockup webpage of imaginary German vacations. This was a lesson project introducing Bootstrap, and was the first time we used it. Created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with Aaron N. at Epicodus.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <a href="#"><img src="images/future.png" alt="Photo of a webpage"></a>
          <p>This was a mock-portfolio page created while taking online courses in basic HTML and CSS with codecademy.com. I pushed it to github so I could polish issues like scalability once I have learned more.</p>

          <p>This cat was created using only CSS as a self-assigned exercise to hone my CSS knowledge. It has a hover effect that reveals the word "meow". Created on codepen.io.</p>

<!--my story-->
      <div id="story" class="">
        <p>I grew up in Salt Lake city, UT. I attended many schools there and lived in many different parts of the Salt Lake vally. I also lived briefly in Alaska, California, Virginia and Lakewood, WA.</p>
        <p>My upbringing instilled in me a deep love for the outdoors and a near obsession with books. When the weather was nice, my dad and our family spent our weekends camping at the high mountian lakes, waterskiing and windsurfing. My best friend's mother would regularly take us on road trips to see the National Parks in the region- from Mesa Verde, CO to Yellowstone. My mother and both of my grandmothers were avid readers, and they passed their love on to me. I found video games on my own, and have yet to put them down.</p>
        <p>I still spend most of my free time reading; playing long, story-heavy rpgs;
        or jumping in the car with my camera and my wife to explore our world.</p>
        <p>We moved to the Seattle area in 2013, and got married in Poulsbo in 2015. I started Epicodus in 2017, and plan to take over the world by 2020.</p>
