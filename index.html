            <p>This project was created to learn how to apply our own CSS styles along with our newly-discovered <span class="purple">Bootstrap</span> options. The goal was to recreate an old Wikipedia home page from a screnshot. Created with HTML, CSS and <span class="purple">Bootstrap</span> with Aaron N. at <span class="teal">Epicodus.</span></p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Salt Lake city, UT. I attended many schools there and lived in many different parts of the Salt Lake vally. I also lived briefly in Alaska, California, Virginia and Lakewood, WA.</p>
        <p>My upbringing instilled in me a deep love for the outdoors and a near obsession with books. When the weather was nice, my dad and our family spent our weekends camping at the high mountian lakes, waterskiing and windsurfing. My best friend's mother would regularly take us on road trips to see the National Parks in the region- from Mesa Verde, CO to Yellowstone. My mother and both of my grandmothers were <em>avid</em> readers, and they passed their love on to me. I found video games on my own, and have yet to put them down.</p>
        <p>I still spend most of my free time reading; playing long, story-heavy rpgs;
        or jumping in the car with my camera and my wife to explore our world.</p>
        <p>We moved to the Seattle area in 2013, and got married in Poulsbo in 2015. I started Epicodus in 2017, and plan to take over the world by 2020.</p>
