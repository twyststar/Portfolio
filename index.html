          <h2>Learning to Code</h2>
          <p><strong>I have just embarked on my journey as a developer. Here is my portfolio so far.</strong></p>

            <a href="https://twyststar.github.io/wiki" target="_blank"><img src="images/wiki.png" alt="Photo of a webpage"></a>
            <p>This project was created to learn how to apply our own CSS styles along with our newly-discovered <span class="purple">Bootstrap</span> options. The goal was to recreate an old Wikipedia home page from a screnshot. Created using HTML, CSS, <span class="purple">Bootstrap</span>, and Github with Aaron N. at <span class="teal">Epicodus.</span></p>

            <a href="https://twyststar.github.io/vacation" target="_blank"><img src="images/vacation.png" alt="Photo of a webpage"></a>
            <p>A mockup webpage of imaginary German vacations. This was a lesson project introducing <span class="purple">Bootstrap</span>, and was the first time we used it. Created using HTML, CSS, <span class="purple">Bootstrap</span>, and Github with Aaron N. at <span class="teal">Epicodus.</span></p>

            <p>This was a mock-portfolio page created while taking online courses in basic HTML and CSS with codecademy.com. I pushed it to Github so I could polish issues like scalability once I have learned more. Created using HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>This cat was created using only CSS as a self-assigned exercise to hone my CSS knowledge. Click to view the page and you'll find the cat has a hover effect that reveals the word "Meow". Created on <span class="gray">codepen.io</span>.</p>

          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="lead">Places</li>
            <img class="rsmall" src="images/rock.JPG" alt="picture of a lake">
            <p>I grew up in Salt Lake city, UT. I attended many schools there and lived in many different parts of the Salt Lake vally. I also lived briefly in Alaska, California, Virginia and Lakewood, WA.</p>
            <li class="lead">People and Places</li>
            <p>My upbringing instilled in me a deep love for the outdoors and a near obsession with books. When the weather was nice, my dad and our family spent our weekends camping at the high mountian lakes, waterskiing and windsurfing. My best friend's mother would regularly take us on road trips to see the National Parks in the region- from Mesa Verde, CO to Yellowstone. My mother and both of my grandmothers were <em>avid</em> readers, and they passed their love on to me.</p>
            <li class="lead">Things</li>
            <img class="rsmall"src="images/serenity.jpg" alt="">
            <p>I still spend a lot of my free time reading. I love fiction, fantasy, sci-fi and science fact books, but will read and collect a wide range of books. I enjoy playing long, story-heavy rpgs, mostly on my PlayStation though I aspire to move into computer gaming. I also aspire to some day play a game of table-top D&D...I am a D&D geek who has never played an actual game.</p>
            <li class="lead">Places with Person and Things</li>
            <img class="lsmall" src="images/camera.jpg" alt="photo of photographer">
            <p>My favorite thing to do is jump in the car with my camera and my wife to explore our world. We love to spend time on the Olympic Peninsula, and actually took a road trip there for our honeymoon!</p>
            <li class="lead">Plans</li>
            <p><strong>We moved to the Seattle area in 2013, and got married in Poulsbo in 2015. I started Epicodus in 2017, and plan to take over the world by 2020.</strong></p>

          <h2>My Previous Work</h2>
          <p>I began my journey toward being a developer in 2017. I needed a new path in life, something challenging, something that is constantly evolving. I started to research the ways to break into computers (yes, that broad term was my first idea!), and found myself drawn to coding. Once I tried it, via a few different online resources, I was hooked! So I joined <span class="teal">Epicodus</span> to start my new adventure.<br>Here's what I did before then:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grout Doctor</strong></li>
            <img class="rsmall" src="images/grout.jpg" alt="before and after grout repair">
            <p>We repaired tile grout. Clean, seal, recaulk, replace- whatever it needed to look new again and make the customer happy. I was a senior tech, so I also provided work estimates and did scheduling in addition to the grout work itself.</p>
            <li><strong>Shopko Receiving Specialist</strong></li>
            <img  class="rsmall" src="images/dock.jpg" alt="receiving dock">
            <p>I was in charge of all direct shipping into the store and all vendor/dc returns shipping out. I also got to build all the display furniture and assist with customers.</p>
            <li><strong>Bartender</strong></li>
            <img class="rsmall" src="images/bar.jpg" alt="drinks">
            <p>I served the drinks! More than that, I had to know when <em>not</em> to serve the drinks. This job also included a grab bag of maintenance duties, from fixing bar equipment to getting on the roof to service the swamp coolers.</p>
            <li><strong>Snomobile Tour</strong></li>
            <img class="rsmall" src="images/tram.jpg" alt="Snowbird tram">
            <p>This was a fun one! We ran guided snowmobile tours in the backcountry from Snowbird Ski Resort. My duties were to get people checked in and take them on a ride up the arial tram, <strong><em>down</em></strong> a ski-lift, and teach them to ride snowmobiles. We were all required to be first-aid and avalanche safety certified, and to take regular training to keep up to date.</p>
          </ul>
          <p>I also spent time doing front and back-end retail, managing the grill part of a bar and grill, and delivering for an artisan bread company. I have made pizza and coffee, been the janitor for a busy ski bar, run a message center, and done groundsman tree work. I have been on teams, run teams, and worked completely solo. Above all, I am highly adaptable and capable of working with people on any level. I deliver perfect customer service whether the customer are bar patrons, homeowners needing repair, first-time visitors to the snow, or my fellow employees.</p>
